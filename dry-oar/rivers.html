                        <h1>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h1>
                        <p>
                            This is the Grand daddy of all canyons and the grand
                            daddy of all river trips. You will never forget your
                            visit to the Grand Canyon. Grand Canyon river
                            rafting combines world-class whitewater with
                            breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable
                            river experience. The canyon is filled not only with
                            exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side
                            canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by
                            river. CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique
                            river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are
                            technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate
                            such a wide variety of rapids and river variances.
                            However, most people are familiar with the regular I
                            - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.

                        <h1>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h1>
                        <p>
                            Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of
                            the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river
                            flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea.
                            High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery,
                            and great rapids have made this run famous. This
                            84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys
                            Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts
                            outstanding scenery, interesting geologic
                            formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic
                            human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
                            Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually
                            done in 6 days Desolation Canyon has been recognized
                            as a National Landmark. This designation is based on
                            the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon
                            tells.

                        <h1>Main Fork of the Salmon, Idaho</h1>
                        <p>
                            Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No
                            Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given
                            the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by
                            the people living near it because of the number of
                            folks that came to visit and fell so in love with
                            the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
                            Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around
                            the river and bear and bighorn sheep are also
                            commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined
                            with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower over
                            the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide
                            shelter from sun or rain when needed. Lets not
                            forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. the
                            Salmon is one of the longest un-damned rivers in the
                            United States. As a free flowing river the water is
                            higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and
                            lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There
                            are good rapids all summer...but families with
                            children who like to swim tend to appreciate the
                            late summer's slower, warmer water more.
